# tjdiag — P0601 debugger for a 2004 Jeep Wrangler

A command line tool that connects to the Jeep through an ELM327-type OBD2
adapter and works out what is behind a P0601 ("internal controller failure /
memory checksum") code, instead of guessing and replacing the computer.

It answers three questions, in order:

1. **Which computer reports P0601?** The engine computer (PCM) or the separate
   transmission computer (TCM) of the 42RLE automatic.
2. **Does it come back after clearing, and when?** At key-on before the engine
   starts, only once the engine has cranked, or not at all.
3. **Is the supply to blame?** Voltage codes, low resting voltage, cranking
   dips, or the computer going silent.

> **Status:** every command has been run against the built-in simulator only.
> It has not been run on the Jeep yet. The first real run is the real test;
> everything the adapter says is recorded in `tjdiag-data/traffic.log` so any
> surprise can be fixed from that log.

## Install

Needs Python 3.10 or newer on a laptop.

```
cd jeep-p0601
pip install -e .
```

## Connect the adapter

1. Plug the adapter into the diagnostic connector under the dash and turn the
   key to ON (the engine can stay off).
2. Pair it with the laptop in the operating system's Bluetooth settings (the
   PIN on these dongles is usually `1234` or `0000`). USB adapters need no
   pairing.
3. Find its serial port:

   ```
   tjdiag ports
   ```

   Typical names: `COM5` (Windows), `/dev/cu.OBDII-SPPDev` (macOS),
   `/dev/rfcomm0` (Linux, after `sudo rfcomm bind 0 <adapter address>`).

If the dongle pairs but no serial port appears, it is a Bluetooth Low Energy
device, which this version cannot open. See
[docs/adapter-evaluation.md](docs/adapter-evaluation.md).

## The procedure

Run these in order. Replace `COM5` with your port.

| Step | Key position | Command | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ON, engine off | `tjdiag --port COM5 probe` | Is this adapter good enough? |
| 2 | ON, engine off | `tjdiag --port COM5 snapshot` | Which computer holds the code, freeze frame, voltage |
| 3 | — | multimeter checks in [docs/diagnostic-flow.md](docs/diagnostic-flow.md) | Rule out battery and grounds |
| 4 | ON, engine off | `tjdiag --port COM5 clear --yes` | Saves a snapshot, then clears |
| 5 | off 30 s, then ON | `tjdiag --port COM5 snapshot` | Did it come back before the engine ran? |
| 6 | start while it logs | `tjdiag --port COM5 watch` | Catch a voltage dip during cranking |
| 7 | engine running | `tjdiag --port COM5 snapshot` | Did it come back once running? |
| 8 | — | `tjdiag diagnose` | Conclusion and next steps |

`tjdiag diagnose` can be run at any point; it tells you what is known so far
and what to do next.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ports` | Lists serial ports. |
| `probe` | Tests the adapter: identity, J1850 VPW, module addressing, checksums, code reading, bus monitoring. Clears nothing. |
| `snapshot [--label TEXT]` | Reads stored and pending codes per module, readiness, freeze frame, live data. Saves JSON. |
| `watch [--seconds N]` | Logs connector voltage and engine speed to CSV. |
| `sniff [--seconds N]` | Records raw PCI bus traffic and counts message identifiers. |
| `clear --yes` | Saves a snapshot, then clears codes. Refuses while the engine runs. |
| `diagnose` | Interprets everything saved so far. |
| `raw "TEXT"` | Sends one command to the adapter and prints the reply. |

Global options: `--port`, `--baud`, `--dir` (where files are saved, default
`./tjdiag-data`), `--sim` (see below).

## Try it without the Jeep

```
tjdiag --sim pcm probe
tjdiag --sim pcm snapshot
tjdiag --sim pcm clear --yes
tjdiag --sim pcm:after-clear-keyon snapshot
tjdiag diagnose
```

Scenarios: `pcm`, `tcm`, `pcm-silent-tcm`, `lowvolt`, `transient`, `clean`,
`clone`, `limited`, `ignition-off`. Add `:after-clear-keyon` or
`:after-clear-running` to see the vehicle after a clear. Use a separate
`--dir` for simulator runs so they do not mix with real data.

## Things to know before using it on the Jeep

- **Clearing codes resets the readiness monitors.** The Jeep will not pass an
  emissions test until they complete again after some driving.
- **The voltage shown is measured by the adapter at the connector**, not at the
  computer, and cheap adapters can be off by a few tenths of a volt. Confirm
  anything important with the multimeter.
- **The adapter samples a few times a second.** A very short dip can be missed;
  a clean `watch` log is weaker evidence than a dip is.
- **The diagnosis is a set of rules applied to the data on hand.** It narrows
  the search. It does not replace measuring the computer's power and grounds.
- **This tool only reads and clears.** It cannot write to or reprogram a
  computer.

## What this cannot do

No ELM327-type adapter can use Chrysler's SCI link, which is the only route to
the computer's own memory. If the procedure ends at "the computer fails its own
self-test", the next step is the interface described in
[docs/phase2-sci-interface.md](docs/phase2-sci-interface.md).
