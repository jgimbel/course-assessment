"""Turns saved snapshots, clears and voltage logs into a diagnosis.

The reasoning follows docs/diagnostic-flow.md:

1. Which module reports P0601?
2. After clearing, does it come back, and when?
     - with the key on, before the engine is started  -> the module fails its
       own power-up self-test
     - only once the engine has cranked or run          -> look at its supply
     - not at all                                       -> one-time event
3. Is there independent evidence of a supply problem (voltage codes, low or
   dipping voltage)?

Everything here is a rule of thumb applied to the data on hand. It narrows the
search; it does not replace measuring the computer's power and grounds.
